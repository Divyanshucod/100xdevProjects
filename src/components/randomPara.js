export const paragraphRandom = `hey there! so, about those 8 planets orbiting our sun - pretty wild, right? first off, we've got the inner planets - mercury, venus, earth (our awesome home!), and mars. they're like the rocky gang, all small and dense. then there's the asteroid belt chillin' in the middle, just a bunch of space rocks vibin'. after that, we hit the gas giants - jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune. these guys are the big kahunas, all swirling with crazy storms and tons of moons. jupiter's got this rad storm called the great red spot that's been raging for like hundreds of years! and saturn's rocking those iconic rings. uranus and neptune are the ice giants, kinda mysterious with their funky tilted orbits. but yeah, those are the main 8 planets making up our cosmic neighborhood, each one unique and fascinating in its own way! 
a detailed paragraph on planets, written in a casual style similar to the provided example.
so, get this - there are these totally wild things called planets that are just floating around in space. our solar system's got 8 of 'em and they're all pretty different from each other. take mercury for example - it's super tiny and way close to the sun so it's crazy hot. but then there's jupiter which is like, mind-bogglingly huge. seriously massive. and it's got this wicked storm called the great red spot that's been raging for hundreds of years. how insane is that?! venus is actually the hottest of them all, even though mercury is closer to the sun. and mars has these ginormous volcanoes and canyons. meanwhile, saturn's just showing off with its flashy rings. uranus and neptune are these ice giant oddballs chillin' way out on the edge of the solar system. and then there's our very own earth, just casually being the perfect place for us humans to live on. planets, man - they're a wild bunch, each with their own quirks and personalities. gotta love 'em!
A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is generally required to be in orbit around a star, stellar remnant, or brown dwarf, and is not one itself.[1] The Solar System has eight planets by the most restrictive definition of the term: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion.
The word planet comes from the Greek πλανήται (planḗtai) 'wanderers'. In antiquity, this word referred to the Sun, Moon, and five points of light visible to the naked eye that moved across the background of the stars—namely, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Planets have historically had religious associations: multiple cultures identified celestial bodies with gods, and these connections with mythology and folklore persist in the schemes for naming newly discovered Solar System bodies. Earth itself was recognized as a 
planet when heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the 16th and 17th centuries.
With the development of the telescope, the meaning of planet broadened to include objects only visible with assistance: the moons of the planets beyond Earth; the ice giants Uranus and Neptune; Ceres and other bodies later recognized to be part of the asteroid belt; and Pluto, later found to be the largest member of the collection of icy bodies known as the Kuiper belt. The discovery of other large objects in the Kuiper belt, particularly Eris, spurred debate about how exactly to define a planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a definition of a planet in the Solar System, placing the four terrestrial planets and the four giant planets in the planet category; Ceres, Pluto, and Eris are in the category of dwarf planet.[2][3][4] Many planetary scientists have nonetheless continued to apply the term planet more broadly, including dwarf planets as well as rounded satellites like the Moon.[5]
Further advances in astronomy led to the discovery of over five thousand planets outside the Solar System, termed exoplanets. These often show unusual features that the Solar System planets do not show, such as hot Jupiters—giant planets that orbit close to their parent stars, like 51 Pegasi b—and extremely eccentric orbits, such as HD 20782 b. The discovery of brown dwarfs and planets larger than Jupiter also spurred debate on the definition, regarding where exactly to draw the line between a planet and a star. Multiple exoplanets have been found to orbit in the habitable zones of their stars (where liquid water can potentially exist on a planetary surface), but Earth remains the only planet known to support life.
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they coalesce during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust. A protostar forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk. Through accretion (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become increasingly dense until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets.[6] After a planet reaches a mass somewhat larger than Mars's mass, it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere,[7] greatly increasing the capture rate of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag.[8][9] Depending on the accretion history of solids and gas, a giant planet, an ice giant, or a terrestrial planet may result.[10][11][12] It is thought that the regular satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus formed in a similar way;[13][14] however, Triton was likely captured by Neptune,[15] and Earth's Moon[16] and Pluto's Charon might have formed in collisions.[17]
When the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star, the surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects.[18][19] Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a larger, combined protoplanet or release material for other protoplanets to absorb.[20] Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.[21][22]
